## Description

Employee Directory is a simple React.js web page that displays a table of employees with filtering and sorting functionalities. The user is able to sort the table by firstname, lastname, job title, department, and employee number in ascending or descending order. The user is also able to search the table and use the autocomplete functionality. The employee data is randomly generated by the `npm faker package` with a seed set for predictable results. The intent of this project was to explore the use of React components, props, state management, and life cycle events.
